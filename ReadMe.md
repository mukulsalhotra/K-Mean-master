## Project to implment K-Mans in Java

Java Version: 1.8 
Eclipse Version: Kepler(4.3 or higher)

1. Copy all files contained in the zip-Archive to a new directory in your Eclipse workspace, e.g. ```workspace/KMeansAssignment ```


2. Create a new Java-Project in Eclipse that has the same name as the directory you just created, e.g. `KMeansAssignment`

3. Make sure that all *.jar files contained in the "lib" directory are listed as `referenced libraries` 
   
   *If the are not listed as referenced libraries, open the project's properties, and add each jar file to the "build path".*


4. Eclipse should be able to compile KMeansMain.java. You can now start programming.


5. Finally, create a new *RunConfiguration* called 
`Java-Application` and add the class `src.KMeansMain.java` as main class.
   Press `Run` and your program should start.
